Hi

There is a need to define internal leaves and attendance policy that all team members must follow. These are not new but we are reiterating the need for it. Please follow these guidelines wef 11 April 2016.


1) Leaves must be planned and approved by client/Reporting head for most cases. Also not to ask client about leave approval, unless told by HR/Reporting head (case to case basis).

2) Any unplanned leaves/short leaves/Shift time Change must be first informed and approved by TL/PL/your immediate reporting head. No direct communication with HR for unplanned leaves.

If leaves are approved by your reporting head, you must email him and HR a formal request before/after taking such leaves.

Frequent unplanned leaves will be taken very seriously. 

3) Every team member must follow 9:00 hrs stiputed shift including 1 hour break. Also follow 8 Hrs work schedule inside your office premises. Excess Break hours beyond 1 hour is not permissible and invite disciplinary actions.


4) You must follow required work reporting as advised by your reporting head and keep a record of your daily activity for review purpose.


5) If a team member found violating these rules, suitable action will be taken, not limited to marking absent, deduction in salary for half day/Full day/ number of days, formal showcause notice.

[It is also seen that people are taking longer breaks and extending it to 2-3 hrs at some occassions.]

[Your work and personal life are equally important and it is an matter of priority and judgement how to balance.]
